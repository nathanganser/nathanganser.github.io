<h2 id="a-few-things-everyone-should-know-about-vietnam">A few things everyone should know about Vietnam</h2>
<p>Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are ranked among the top-10 most dynamic cities due to their low cost, rapid consumer market expansion, strong population growth, and transition towards activities attracting significant amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI) according to the <a href="https://www.joneslanglasalle.com.vn/en/trends-and-insights/research/city-momentum-index-2020">City Momentum Index 2020</a> report covering 130 cities worldwide.</p>
<p>Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world with 7.1 and 7.0 per cent GDP growth in 2018 and 2019 according to the <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/34268/Taking-Stock-What-will-be-the-New-Normal-for-Vietnam-The-Economic-Impact-of-COVID-19.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y">World Bank</a> and although its growth rate declined to 2.91 percent in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the country's growth rate remains <a href="https://en.vietnamplus.vn/vietnam-one-of-fastest-growing-economies-wb/194979.vnp">among the highest</a> in the region and globally.</p>
<p>Vietnam has also the fastest-growing middle class in the region. Vietnam's middle class accounts for 13 per cent of the total population and this figure is expected to reach 26 per cent by 2026. Vietnam's <a href="https://www.wealthx.com/report/world-ultra-wealth-report-2019">super-rich population</a> is also growing faster than elsewhere and there is no doubt that it will continue to rise over the next ten years.</p>
<p>The implementation of the EU Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) stimulated growth in bilateral trade between Vietnam and the EU with two-way trade turnover reaching USD 17.8 billion during the first four months of implementation (August-November 2020), reflecting an increase of 2.9 per cent compared to the same period the year before.</p>
<p>Some important business etiquettes to note when doing business in Vietnam:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Vietnamese prefer discussions to be held in person rather than online, unless the latter is the only way to go (i.e. due to lockdown imposed by the Government amid Covid-19 pandemic). Although English is gaining popularity, whenever possible, we recommend you have a translator with you. Ideally, you learn to speak a few simple words in Vietnamese to show that you respect the culture and that you make an effort to make business deals happen.</li>
<li>Similarly, your business card should be in both English and Vietnamese. When giving or receiving business cards, do so with both of your hands.</li>
<li>Seniority and hierarchy are important in Vietnam. When working with an older male, refer to him as "Anh" followed by his first name. When working with an older female, refer to her as "Chị" followed by her first name. When shaking hands or handing business cards or documents, always address the people with the highest senority first.</li>
<li>Names: Vietnamese names follow the format of family name-middle name-first name. Some people have more than one middle name and some don't have any. People refer to each other by their first name, or middle name and first name (to differentiate from others with the same first name) and never family name.</li>
<li>It is highly recommended to have all work documents translated to Vietnamese.</li>
<li>Vietnamese businesspersons tend to reply to investors introduced to them via a mutual connection, rather than cold calling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visa: In order to enter Vietnam, a foreigner needs to obtain an entry visa issued by the Department of Immigration under Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security (for issuance and renewal).</p>
<p>Visas can be obtained electrically. Vietnam updated the process and procedures for the <a href="https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/web/guest/trang-chu-ttdt">e-visa system</a>, allowing visitors of single-entry visits with a duration of up to 30 days to apply for and obtain their visas electronically. The processing time for e-visas is three working days after completing registration and making the fee payment.

<h3 id="what-is-defined-as-an-sme">What is defined as an SME?</h3>
<p>SMEs comprise microenterprises, small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises as determined in Article 6 of Decree No. 39/2018/ND-CP. The determination of SMEs according to the Decree follows two sets of criteria; (1) the sectoral group the enterprise operates in and (2) its average number of employees, its annual revenues and its total investment capital as follows:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>SectorsCriteria</th>
<th>Agriculture, forestry and aquaculture, industrial, construction</th>
<th>Trade and service</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The average number of employees participating in social insurance per year</td>
<td>Microenterprise: 10 or lessSmall enterprise: 100 or lessMedium enterprise: 200 or fewer</td>
<td></td>

<tr>
<td>Annual revenue</td>
<td>Microenterprise: max VND 3 billionSmall enterprise: max VND 50 billionMedium enterprise: max VND 200 billion</td>

<td>Microenterprise: max VND 3 billionSmall enterprise: max VND 50 billionMedium enterprise: max VND 100 billion</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>In order to be categorized as a micro, small or medium size enterprise, an enterprise must satisfy two of the above-stated conditions, i.e. (1) the average number of employees participating in social insurance per year and (2) the amounts of their annual revenue <strong>or</strong> total investment capital in their business project. If a company cannot fulfill two criteria, then the local authority has the power to decide its status taking into account various metrics such as the accumulated revenue in the last five years etc.</p>
<p><strong>What are the most prevalent types of SMEs? (micro, small or medium)</strong><br>
Small and micro enterprises (both local and foreign-invested) account for a very large proportion of SMEs in Vietnam, whereas the number of medium sized enterprises accounts for only 1.6 percent of SMEs.</p>
<p><strong>In which sectors do SMEs operate ?</strong><br>
Local and foreign-invested SMEs account for around 96.7 per cent of total enterprises in Vietnam (as of September 2020). Most SMEs operate in the commerce, services and industrial sectors especially in traditional handicraft, exploiting and producing raw products such as minerals, seafood, forest products, processing and assembly, manufacturing high-tech products (machinery, electronics, chemicals, measuring equipment, engines, etc.).</p>
<p>In recent years, the trend of developing innovative business models (in the form startups, which are considered as SMEs in Vietnam) has been growing especially in areas such as construction, processing, manufacturing, the automotive industry, air transport, finance and banking. Currently, there are more than 3,000 active innovative startups, most of them are invested by startup funds from the US and Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>How ready are SMEs in Vietnam for the 4.0 Industrial revolution (i.e. technology adaptation)?</strong></p>
<p>With a young and technology savvy workforce, increased connectivity and presence of many large global technology corporations, the rapid technology innovation and adoption is difusing fast in Vietnam including its SMEs. Kindly find <a href="https://www.ilo.org/hanoi/Whatwedo/Publications/WCMS_630854/lang--en/index.htm">here</a> an analysis of International Labor Organiaztion on the readiness of Vietnam's labor maket to innovate and adapt to technology in the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>How many employees work in SMEs in the last 5 years?</strong></p>
<p>The latest data shows that between 2016 and 2017 the SME sector attracted 8.69 million employees. In the two years 2017-2018, the number of newly established SMEs also created nearly 2.3 million new jobs</p>
<p><strong>How have SMEs contributed to Vietnam’s economy?</strong></p>
<p>Every year, SMEs contribute about 40 per cent to Vietnam's GDP, 30 per cent to the state budget, 33 per cent of industrial output value, 30 per cent of export value and attract nearly 60 per cent of employees nationwide.</p>
<h2 id="the-eu-vietnam-free-trade-agreement-an-introduction-in-few-paragraphs">The EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement: An introduction in few paragraphs</h2>
<p>The EVFTA is the most comprehensive and ambitious trade and investment agreement that the EU has concluded with a developing country in Asia and is the second free trade agreement concluded in the ASEAN region after the EU-Singapore FTA.</p>
<p>The EVFTA is envisaged to intensify bilateral trade and investment relations between Vietnam and the EU and is contributing to developing Vietnam into a manufacturing hub in Asia.</p>
<p>In services, Vietnam has not only liberalized additional sub-sectors for EU services and service providers under the EVFTA, but also made deeper commitments than those made under WTO Agreements, offering European services the best possible access to Vietnam's market in sectors and subsectors such as, for example, interdisciplinary Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) services; nursing services, services provided by physiotherapists and para-medical personnel; packaging services; trade fairs and exhibitions services and building-cleaning services.</p>
<p>In addition, for the sectors listed in Vietnam's <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2020:186:FULL&amp;from=EN#page=1113">Specific Schedule of Commitments</a> under the Agreement, except where there are specific reservations, Vietnam undertakes not to apply restrictions related to: (i) the number of businesses allowed to participate in the market, (ii) the transaction value, (iii) the number of activities, (iv) foreign capital contribution, (v) the form of legal entities, and (vi) the number of natural persons recruited.</p>
<p>In goods trade, Vietnam commited to eliminate import duties on 48.5 percent of tariff lines, equivalent to 64.5 percent of EU exports to vietnam from 1 August 2020.</p>
<p>In public procurement, Vietnam committed to treating EU bidders, or domestic bidders with EU investment capital, equally like Vietnamese bidders when the Government purchases goods or requests services worth over a specified threshold.</p>
<p>You can find the full text of the EVFTA <a href="https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1437">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-applicable-tariff-rates-including-tariff-rate-quotas-and-rules-of-origin-for-my-products">What are the applicable tariff rates (including tariff rate quotas) and rules of origin for my products?</h2>
<p>The preferential import tariff schedule of Vietnam under the EVFTA (effective from 1 August 2020 to 31 December 2022) can be found below. The preferential import tariff schedule for the next periods will be issued by the Government of Vietnam at a later stage. The Ministry of Industry and Trade issues the annual quotas for these products every year.</p>
<p>Import tariff rate quotas are applied to the following products and quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw tobacco (HS Code 2401): 62,053 tons (18 January 2021 to 31 December 2021);</li>
<li>Chicken eggs (HS codes 0407.21.00 and 0407.90.10), duck eggs, swans (HS codes 0407.29.10 and 0407.90.20), and others (HS codes 0407.29.90 and 0407.90.90): 60,819 tons (2021);</li>
<li>Salt (HS code 2501): 80,000 tons (2021);</li>
<li>Sugar (HS code 1701): 108,000 tons (2021).</li>
</ul>
<p>In-quota import of these products from the EU to Vietnam is subject to the preferential import tariff rate stipulated in the schedule. Imports of these products in quantities beyond the above qoutas are subject to the general (MFN) tariff rates.</p>
<p>To enjoy preferential in quota tariff rates, importers need to obtain an import quota license from the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The application dossier, to be submitted to the Import- Export Department of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, shall include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An original request for import tariff quotas made according to the Form below (available only in Vietnamese);</li>
<li>A self-certified true copy of an Investment Registration Certificate or Enterprise Registration Certificate of the importer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that for the import of tobacco raw materials, the importer must have a license to produce cigarettes issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and have a demand to import tobacco raw materials for cigarettes production.</p>
<p>The in-tariff quotas for refined sugar and raw sugar is currently subject to a pilot auction program by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</p>
<p><strong>What are the rules of origin for my products?</strong></p>
<p>Your products are considered as originating from the EU under the EVFTA if they meet one of the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products wholly obtained in the EU (such as for example plants, minerals, live animals); or</li>
<li>Products produced in the EU incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing within the EU.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is simple for wholly obtained products in the EU to be considered as originating from the EU, the EVFTA sets out a set of working or processing procedures for products based on their HS Codes to qualify for originating status. Thus, you will need to check the HS codes of products intended to be imported into Vietnam to find their respective originating requirements.</p>
<p>The below operations are not considered as sufficient working or processing to confer origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;</li>
<li>breaking-up and assembly of packages;</li>
<li>washing, cleaning, removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;</li>
<li>ironing or pressing of textiles and textile articles;</li>
<li>simple painting and polishing operations;</li>
<li>husking and partial or total milling of rice; polishing and glazing of cereals and rice;</li>
<li>perations to color or flavor sugar or form sugar lumps; partial or total milling of crystal sugar;</li>
<li>peeling, stoning and shelling of fruits, nuts and vegetables;</li>
<li>sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;</li>
<li>sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, or matching (including the making-up of sets of articles);</li>
<li>simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;</li>
<li>affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;</li>
<li>simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any material;</li>
<li>simple addition of water, dilution, dehydration or denaturation of products;</li>
<li>simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;</li>
<li>a combination of two or more of the operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (o); or</li>
<li>slaughter of animals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the rules of origin for fabrics/ textile products?</strong><br>
See <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/system/files/2021-06/evfta_guide.pdf">https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/system/files/2021-06/evfta_guide.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>How do I determine the EU origin status? What forms to use?</strong></p>
<p>European products imported in Vietnam benefit from the tariff preference under the EVFTA upon the submission of a statement of origin made by exporters registered in the Registered Exporter System (REX) - an electronic database – and in accordance with the relevant legislation in the EU. The text of the origin statement can be found <a href="https://trungtamwto.vn/file/19690/protocol-1.pdf">here</a> (Annex VI to Protocol 1 of the EVFTA – English version).</p>
<p>Registration in the REX database is valid throughout the customs territory of the EU and therefore the REX number assigned to an exporter may be used irrespective of the place where products are declared for exportation and the country of export.</p>
<p>The REX database does not require exporters to specify the countries for which the registration is done. Therefore, an exporter already holding a REX number for purposes of exporting to GSP beneficiary countries, to Japan or to Canada, for example, may use the same REX number for purposes of exporting to Vietnam.</p>
<p><em>Notes to the text of origin statement:</em></p>
<p>For EU exporters exporting to Vietnam, the customs authorization number will be the registration number (REX number) and not the approved exporter authorization number.</p>
<p>For goods originating in the EU, the origin to be indicated in (2) is "EU".</p>
<p>Statements on origin made by registered exporters do not need to be signed.</p>
<p>Exporters who are not registered exporters may still complete a statement of origin up to the value threshold of EUR 6,000, for each consignment. Such statements of origin must bear the signature of the exporter in manuscript. Therefore, the original document on which a statement of origin is made should be provided to the importer in Vietnam.</p>

<p><strong>General customs clearance procedures</strong></p>
<p>The customs declaration dossier for imported goods must be submitted before the goods reach the border or within 30 days from the date when the goods reach the border. If the means of transport follow electronic customs procedures, the date of arrival of goods at the entry point is the date of arrival of the means of transport at the checkpoint as informed by the shipping company on the e-customs system. In case the means of transport follow manual customs procedures for entry, the date of arrival of goods at the checkpoint is the day on which the customs authority appends the seal on the declaration of imports at the port of discharge which is enclosed with documents about the means of transport (by sea, by air, or by rail) or the date written on the declaration of means of transport crossing the checkpoint or the logbook of means of transport (by river or by road).</p>
<p>The whole customs dossiers can be submitted online. After receiving the dossier, the system will check the conditions for registering the submitted customs declaration form, and if such conditions are met, the customs authority approves the <a href="http://registration.In">registration.In</a> case of a need for correction, it is possible to correct the data directly in the online customs dossier. on the basis of that, the customs authority in charge will decide on one of the following customs inspection forms and levels based on the result of the online system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lane 1:</strong> Accept information on the declaration. The goods can be cleared from customs without having to go through further steps.</li>
<li><strong>Lane 2</strong> : Inspect relevant documents of the customs dossier submitted or presented by the declarant or relevant documents on the National Single-window Information Portal while being exempted from actual inspection of goods.</li>
<li><strong>Lane 3</strong> : Carry out physical inspection of goods based on inspected relevant documents of the customs dossier submitted or presented by the declarant or relevant documents on the National Single-window Information Portal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases where actual inspection is required, if the cargo or any sample of the cargo corresponds accurately with the information contained in the forms and documents, Customs will record the results of the inspection and will release goods to the importer. The Customs Authority may require additional documents/ information to complete its inspection. If the declarant cannot provide that information or the goods are not allowed to be cleared from customs after inspection, the goods stay at the border or are returned by agreement of the importer, the exporter and/or the seller.</p>
<p>In addition, goods which have completed customs procedures but have not paid or fully paid the applicable tax amounts within the regulated time limit, can be released if they have such payable tax amounts guaranteed by a credit institution or enjoy a tax payment time limit in accordance with the tax law.</p>
<p>Further to the above, customs laws also provide customs procedures for goods in transit, goods brought into entrepots, free trade zones, bonded warehouses, duty free warehouse, for temporary import for export goods, for means of transport on entry, exit or in transit.</p>

<p>Yes, Vietnam imposes additional duties or measures on imported goods if these goods cause (i) injurious dumping or (ii) injurious subsidization or (iii) in case of injurious sudden increases of imported goods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-dumping duties</li>
</ul>
<p>Under domestic laws in vientnam, imported goods are subject to anti-dumping duties if an anti-dumping investigation shows that the export price of the imported goods is lower than its normal price, thereby causing or threatening to cause material injury to the affected domestic industry.</p>
<p>Currently Vietnam does not impose any anti-dumping duties on goods imported from the EU.</p>
<ul>
<li>Countervailing duties</li>
</ul>
<p>While anti-dumping duties address the private commercial conduct of exporters, countervailing measures address certain types of subsidies granted by governments. Countervailing measures are applied where the subsidized goods imported into Vietnam cause substantial injury or threaten to cause material injury to the domestic industry or prevent the formation of a domestic industry.</p>
<p>Currently Vietnam does not impose any countervailing duties on goods imported from the EU.</p>
<ul>
<li>Safeguard measures</li>
</ul>
<p>Safeguard measures are measures applied in cases where goods are excessively imported into Vietnam, causing serious damage or threatening to cause serious damage to the domestic industry.</p>
<p>Safeguard measures include applying (i) safeguard tax, (ii) import quotas; (iii) tariff quotas; (iv) import permits; and other safeguard measures.</p>

<p>The EVFTA covers all categories of intellectual property that are referred to in Sections 1 to 7 of Part II of the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>copyright and related rights;</li>

<p>Registration of copyrights is conducted at the National Copyright Office. Copyrights also apply to computer programs that cannot be patented. While no copyright registration is required in Vietnam, most patent experts suggest registering copyrights with the country's copyright authorities.</p>

<ul>
<li>A declaration for registration of copyright or related rights according to the form below (available only in Vietnamese); TODOFile</li>

<h2 id="what-are-the-challenges-faced-by-smes-in-regard-to-access-to-credit">What are the challenges faced by SMEs in regard to access to credit?</h2>
<p>Financial institutions in Vietnam assess the credit "worthiness" of businesses on the basis of criteria such as the firm size, firm age, firm ownership, total asset, return on equity, return on assets which could be challenging for SMEs to satisfy. A 2015 survey conducted by the Provincial Competitiveness Index in Vietnam shows that financial institutions rejected loans to SMEs due to the lack of profitability and the lack of acceptable collateral such as land. Vietnamese Government has made efforts to improve SMEs' access to credit, namely by setting up the SME Development Fund and the Credit Guarantee Fund. The <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/530a7e15-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/530a7e15-en">OECD</a> raised the following limitations of the Vietnamese SME Development Fund (SMEDF): the lack of incentive for commercial banks to apply the SMEDF loan, difficulties for SMEs to comply with the conditions of the loan, difficult selection process, the lack of awareness of the SMEDF by SMEs (see 7.7 below).</p>

<p>The EU and Vietnam commit to promote sustainable development by fostering the contribution of trade and investment related aspects of labor and environmental issues. Vietnam has the right to establish its own levels of domestic protection in the environmental and social areas, as well as modify its policies to match international treaties to which it is a signatory. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2020:186:FULL&amp;from=EN#page=132">Chapter 13</a> of the EVFTA requires Vietnam to uphold multilateral labor standards and agreements (e.g. ILO standards), multilateral environmental agreements, commitments under climate change protocols and commitments to protect biological diversity. Vietnam undertakes to ensure its laws and policies provide for and encourage high levels of domestic protection in the environmental and social areas, meaning companies operating in Vietnam shall be required to comply with EVFTA-related CSR standards.</p>

</table><p>In the event of disagreement on any CSR matters, EU investors can have direct recourse to the EU Committee on Trade and Sustainable Development (Government Consultations) and if it has not been satisfactorily resolved by the Committee, a Panel of Experts under the EVFTA will be formed to solve the matter.</p>
<p>Vietnam does not have separate laws or regulations on CSR but CSR obligations are apparent in key laws such as the Enterprise Law, the Labor Code, the Law on Environmental Protection and CSR has definitely been gaining momentum among businesses in the past years. In fact, since 2005, the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry together with the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Trade together and other associations have awarded the "Corporate Social Responsibility towards Sustainable Development" award yearly to honor businesses that perform their corporate social responsibility well in the context of integration.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-evfta-chapter-on-trade-and-sustainable-development-offer-in-terms-of-labour-rights">What does the EVFTA Chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development offer in terms of labour rights?</h3>
<p>The English version of Vietnam's latest labor code can be found here.</p>
<p>TODOfile</p>
<p>At the heart of EVFTA is the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Declaration focuses on commiting its members to respect and promote core conventions on elimination of child and forced labour, elimination of discrimination at work and promoting gender equality, freedom of association and right to collective bargaining.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) revised the Labour Code towards better alignment with international labour standards, with support from the ILO and other partners, including the EU. An analysis of Vietnam's latest labor code conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO) can be found <a href="https://www.ilo.org/hanoi/Informationresources/Publicinformation/Pressreleases/WCMS_729339/lang--en/index.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Below are the key labour rights addressed in the EVFTA and their corresponding provisions in domestic legislation:</p>
<ul>
<li>the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. This right is recognized by the Vietnamese Labor Code under Article 3, 7, 36,44, 63 and 65. However the strict control of the State poses a challenge to the implementation of this provision.</li>
<li>the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour. This right is recognized by the Vietnamese Labor Code under Article 8.</li>
<li>the effective abolition of child labour. Although the minimum working age in Vietnam is 15 years, chapter XI of the Labor Code still allows enterprises to employ children from the age of 13 years if the enterprises satisfy simple conditions such as taking care of these children, obtaining their parents'approval and making sure they carry out works within their physical and mental capacity. This is not in line with EVFTA standard.</li>
<li>the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. This right is recognized by the Vietnamese Labor Code under Article 8.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some basic obligations under Vietnam laws should be kept in mind by employers and employees:</p>
<p><strong>Normal working hours</strong></p>
<p>Normal working hours shall not exceed eight hours per day or 48 hours per week. However, employers have the right to determine the daily or weekly working hours and inform the employees accordingly. The daily working hours shall not exceed 10 hours per day and 48 hours per week where a weekly basis is applied.</p>
<p>The State encourages employers to apply 40-hour workweeks.</p>
<p>Employers shall limit the time of exposure to harmful elements in accordance with relevant National Technical Regulations and laws.</p>
<p><strong>Maternity protection</strong></p>
<p>The employer must not dismiss an employee or unilaterally terminate the employment contract with an employee due to his/her marriage, pregnancy, maternity leave, or nursing a child under 12 months of age.</p>
<p>Upon expiration of the employment contract with female employee who is pregnant or nursing a child under 12 months of age, conclusion of a new employment contract shall be given priority.</p>
<p>During her menstruation period, a female employee shall be entitled to a 30 minute break in every working day; a female employee nursing a child under 12 months of age shall be entitled to 60 minutes breaks in every working day with full salary as stipulated in the employment contract.</p>
<p><strong>Annual leave</strong></p>
<p>Any employee who has been working for an employer for 12 months is entitled to fully-paid annual leave, which is stipulated in his/her employment contract as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>12 working days for employees who work in normal working conditions;</li>
<li>14 working days for employees that are minors or disabled, employees who do laborious, toxic or dangerous works;</li>
<li>16 working days for employees who do highly laborious, toxic or dangerous works.</li>
</ol>
<p>An employee who has been working for an employer for less than 12 months will have a number of paid leave days proportional to the number of working months.</p>
<p>An employee who, due to employment termination or job loss, has not taken or not entirely taken up his/her annual leave shall be paid in compensation for the untaken leave days.</p>
<p><strong>Sick leave</strong></p>
<p>Employees can enjoy insurance-paid sick leaves, if they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Employees who have to take leave due to sickness or accidents other than labor accidents, with the certification of a competent health establishment under the Ministry of Health's regulations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sickness regime does not cover employees who take leave due to sickness or accidents as a result of self-infliction, drunkenness or use of narcotics or narcotic precursors on the Government-prescribed list.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Employees who have to take leave for caring for sick children aged under 7 years, with the certification of a competent health establishment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Employees working under normal conditions benefit from the regime for the following duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 days, if they have paid social insurance premiums for under 15 years;</li>
<li>40 days, if they have paid social insurance premiums for between 15 years and under 30 years; or</li>
<li>60 days, if they have paid social insurance premiums for 30 years or more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Insurance</strong></p>
<p>Employer and employee agree on the payment of social insurance, health insurance and unemployment insurance. Employee can pay for these insurance by themselves or this is the employer who pays on the employee's behalf by deducting the corresponding amount from the employee's salary.</p>

<p>The English version of Vietnam's Law on Environmental Protection can be found here.</p>
<p>TODO File</p>
<p>Central to the EVFTA provisions on environment protection and climate change is the parties' commitment to adhere to international treaties that they are parties to, namely the <em>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</em> of 1992, the <em>Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention On Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.</em></p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="http://tapchimoitruong.vn/english-edition-i--2019-41/Vietnam%27s-environmental-commitments-and-obligations-under-the-EU-Vietnam-Free-Trade-Agreement--18276">this article</a> published by Vietnam's Department of Environment comparing local regulations to the EVFTA's provisions.</p>
<p>Under Article 5 of the Commercial Law, where a treaty to which Vietnam is a contracting party stipulates the application of foreign laws or international commercial practices, or contains provisions that are inconsistent with this Law, the provisions of such treaty shall apply. This means that, where the EVFTA provides more protection to EU investors than Vietnamese laws do, investors could rely on and make use of provisions of the EVFTA in order to ensure compliance.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-have-to-do-in-case-of-legal-problems-and-disputes-">What do I have to do in case of legal problems and disputes ?</h1>
<p>Investors are given high level of protection under the EVIPA which contains key principles of the New York Convention 1958 and the ICSID 1965. The EVIPA makes it possible for EU investors to sue the Vietnamese Government for its investment related decisions. The final arbitral award is binding and enforceable without any question from the local courts regarding its validity.</p>
<p>In particular, EVIPA stipulates the two-tier arbitration mechanism, in which parties shall appeal if they are not satisfied with the first award issued by the arbitration panel. However, if neither disputing party has appealed the provisional award, the award shall become final and "<em>shall not be subject to appeal, review, set aside, annulment or any other remedy</em>" (Article 3 of the EVIPA).</p>
<p>At the moment, Vietnam has reserved the right to fulfill this commitment for five years from the effective date of the EVIPA (NOTE: The EVIPA has not come into effect yet).</p>
<p>EU investors are advised to recourse to international arbitration such as ICC or SIAC in case of disputes.</p>

<p>When reviewing a general sales and purchase contract, key provisions to look out for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dispute resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A sample dispute resolution clause in a commercial contract would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any differences or disputes arising from this Contract or other agreements related to the Contract performance will be resolved by the mediation efforts between the Parties;</li>
<li>Any disputes or differences related to the contract which cannot be settled based on mediation will be resolved at the Vietnam Arbitration Center.</li>
<li>The costs of arbitration and/or other expenses (includes the cost of hiring a lawyer) shall be borne by the bailiff;</li>
<li>The language of arbitration is Vietnamese.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Termination:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Force majeure: Under Article 156 of the Civil Code, an event of force majeure is an event which occurs in an objective manner which is not able to be foreseen and which is not able to be remedied by all possible necessary and admissible measures being taken.<br>
Typical Force majeure circumstances in contracts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural phenomena such as rain, flood, fire, storm, tsunami, volcanic eruption.</li>
<li>Social phenomena such as wars, coups, strikes, embargoes, changes in government policies</li>
<li>In addition, the parties can agree on events such as: lack of fuel, power failure, network failure, etc., to exempt liability in case of violation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Events of Default:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An event of default is an event specified in a commercial agreement that gives the non-defaulting party the right, among other things, to terminate the agreement. Events of default are common in loan agreements or debt instruments. An event of default entitles the lender to cancel the facility and/or declare all amounts owing by the borrower to be immediately due and payable. Typical events of default in loan agreements include non-payment or late payment of amounts due, breach of certain material <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/I1559f7a3eef211e28578f7ccc38dcbee/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=e87105c5e0544698ade09391389d2359&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)">representations and warranties</a> or <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/I1559f7b0eef211e28578f7ccc38dcbee/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=e87105c5e0544698ade09391389d2359&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)">covenants</a>, <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/I03f4d6f4eee311e28578f7ccc38dcbee/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=e87105c5e0544698ade09391389d2359&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)">cross-default</a><em>,</em> breach of <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/I59dd1228ef2a11e28578f7ccc38dcbee/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=e87105c5e0544698ade09391389d2359&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)">change of control</a> provisions, and <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/I03f4d6f2eee311e28578f7ccc38dcbee/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=e87105c5e0544698ade09391389d2359&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)">insolvency</a>.</p>
<p>Description of events of default should be clearly listed rather than using vague terms such as "in accordance with laws" as the laws cannot cover all possible circumstances and it would be difficult for the investors to comprehend whether a specific activity is an EoD.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-engage-a-lawyer">When to engage a lawyer?</h2>
<p>It is recommended to engage a Vietnam-based law firm to advise and assist you once you decide to do business in Vietnam. Whether you wish to establish a new company or enter into a business cooperation contract with a local partner, a professional lawyer could help you to save time and costs associated with possible fraud or dispute by advising you on the required licenses, solutions to mitigate legal and financial risks as well as carry out in-person negotiation. Businesspersons in Vietnam prefer to discuss and negotiate in person rather than via electronic means of communication unless that is the only way since Vietnamese people prefer the rapport that parties can build face-to-face. As such, it is helpful to have someone on the ground to work on your behalf at least until you arrive in Vietnam.</p>
